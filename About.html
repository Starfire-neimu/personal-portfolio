    <article>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Neima Yesihak, a 17-year-old front-end developer from Ethiopia.
            I love creating beautiful and functional websites that make the web a better place.
            My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how things work, and it has grown into a passion for coding and design.
        </p>
<p>
    <span>I'm a curious and creative front-end developer
    who enjoys turning ideas into interactive digital experiences.
My passion for design and coding started from a love for building
 things that not only work — but look good too!

I believe in growth, collaboration, and staying updated with the latest
 trends in tech and design. Whether I’m learning something new or helping others, 
 I’m always working toward becoming better every day. </span>
